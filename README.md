# azrael
AZRAEL is an rule-based automatic language detector based on the syllable structure and coded in Prolog. AZRAEL can detect Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Catalan, Latin and Basque.

The first version only detected Spanish language and was released in 2009. Since then, French, Italian, Portuguese, Catalan, Latin and Basque language have been added to the project. The `doc` folder contains the report and poster for the 2009 version of AZRAEL.

This project received in 2009 the First Award at the VIII Arquimedes Contest of Introduction to Reasearch awarded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Education.
